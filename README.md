# Portfolio

Hi! I'm Emanuel Casco, an independent developer/artist, I strugle to clasify myself beyond that cause I like a lot of stuff, but some of my passions involve mixing some form of visual art with IT.

In this place you can find a bunch of my stuff, projects that I make, ranging from a little comic to a game.

If you have any question or suggestion feel free to contact me at lemanuelcasco@gmail.com
